Progressive web application to customize photos and insert filters

<h2> Introduction </h2>
This is a simple progressive web application that allows you to apply graphic filters to your photos and you can download the modified photo.

<h2> Description</h2>


To create this PWA I used the "canvas" tag to allow you to edit the image and downloading it.

The web application only works in Chrome and Firefox browsers.
